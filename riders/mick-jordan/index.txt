Stunning view of Skyline Ridge from the 1,700&prime; level on West Alpine Road. Only another 700&prime; to climb from here. Little did I know my derailleur cable was hanging by a thread.

Great riding on the San Francisco Randonneurs SF-Cloverdale weekend. It was my longest ride to date on the P-38 and I can declare it a great success. The usual slow first day but why hurry? The conditions on the coast were perfect &mdash; blue sky and no wind. Plenty of time to unwind and socialize at Cloverdale. The second day I rode hard starting with the club paceline to Guerneville at average speed of 18mph. Mostly overcast at the coast but nice to find that I could keep pace on the climbs with the upright bikes. I can actually use my quads on the P38! Ended up with a PR for a 200K of 8:36. And I was fast enough to ride with royalty Becky Berka) for the first time for ages. Lane Parker pushed me on the hills on century 32 of his quest for 52 this year, and gave me a ride to/from the event; much appreciated. A big thanks to all the volunteers who made the weekend such fun.
