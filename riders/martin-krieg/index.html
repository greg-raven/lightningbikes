					&ldquo;People ask me all the time what the best value for the recumbent buck is. I suggest the Lightning Phantom. It can tour. It can run errands. And it can go very very fast. It is the Taiwanese version of the Lightning P-38 I have been speeding around on here in Davis. <a href="/media/20150104-brol.php">Here is the very good review of the bike</a> that Bryan Ball of &rsquo;BentRider Online did of this respected machine.&rdquo;

				&ldquo;Eric Warp and I rode to Winters today, on our Lightning Cycle Dynamics P-38s, where we got Wild Bill Marlin of early mountain bike racing fame to take a picture of the two of us riding in front of Steady Eddy&rsquo;s Coffee House.&rdquo;

				&ldquo;The small city of Davis, CA, just got a whole lot smaller today! Before the high 90 degree heat that is promised for today, sets in, I took the <a href="/p38/index.html">Lightning Cycle Dynamics P-38</a> for a ride to nearby Dixon. I got happily lost and ended up a few miles from Winters instead. And man has Timothy R. Brummer created a true rocket machine! I ended up doing 35 miles in less than two hours time. And that includes stopping to take pictures and also asking people for directions. And, still learning the bike, I am not pushing any where as hard as I needed to while on the Via LWB to go probably 30% slower.&rdquo;

				&ldquo;Unlike The Eagle Bicycle where everyone who sees me on it passes me, on the P-38 I easily passed everyone I saw ahead of me. And there was a fair number of people riding today. I am not posting this to bait testosterone-charged cyclists to have a go with me. I am only trying show that as one who has lived by the mantra that its not about the machine but about the man who is riding it, I think in the case of the P-38, it is making this man one helluva lot faster!! WoW!!&rdquo;

				&ldquo;On my blazing fast ride back from Winters on the Lightning P-38, I rode the path some of the way as it was dusk. I stopped for a picture of both myself and this little girl playing some kind of sleep on the bike path game with her friend (behind the camera) &hellip;&rdquo; (via Facebook)

					&ldquo;I rode from Davis to Winters, CA, today in 20 minutes on the Lightning Cycle Dynamics P-38! From the edge of Davis, where I started keeping track, I get a distance of ten miles. While I was hammering and doing some experimental stuff with my breath, that just does not seem at all possible. 30 mph? I don&rsquo;t think so. I can believe 24 or 25 mph, but 30? Hmm &hellip;&rdquo; (via Facebook)

					Ran into <a href="/riders/eric-warp/index.html">Eric Warp</a> on my way back from Winters, 17 miles away, a few hours ago. Eric, new to Davis, California, has been away from his Lightning Cycle Dynamics P-38 for a few years. But as he gets his fitness back, I look forward to being able to share with you the fast rides he and I will probably be doing together!!
