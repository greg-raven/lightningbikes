					F-40 Thoughts on speed
				</h1>
				<p>
					14 Sep 2013
				</p>
				<p>
					Today was a good day - 47.3 miles at 20.6 mph.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I would have pushed it a little bit more then today I probably could have done 50 miles at greater than 20 mph.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a couple of goals:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>25 miles at 25 mph</li>
					<li>50 miles at 20 mph</li>
					<li>100k in under 3 hours</li>
					<li>100 miles at 20 mph (ie under 5 hours elapsed time)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					There are a few recumbent riders in the area that are at or above these performance goals:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mark Leuck (http://lifeonabaron.blogspot.com/) </li>
					<li>Ron Swift (http://app.strava.com/athletes/643634)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The first goal of 25 miles at 25 mph is to attack my Functional Threshold Power (FTP). This I am doing by riding intervals 2 or 3 times a week.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>
					The Engine
				</h2>
				<p>
					Weekly strategy:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>3 days riding intervals</li>
					<li>1 long ride of 50 miles @ 20 mph+</li>
					<li>1 long ride of 70 miles @ 19 mph</li>
					<li>2 rest days</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I also need to lose 25 pounds body weight. I have drastically altered my diet to be more fruits, vegies and non-processed food. Started to get serious about the belly because with the P-38 (F-40) my belly keeps flopping on my legs as I peddle.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>
					The Bike
				</h2>
				<p>
					I ordered a new rear wheel that is a deep-v carbon clincher rim like I have on the Musashi. This should give better aero performance. It should be here in about a month.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 100 oz camelbak is not working out. With the longer rides the ice in the camelbak is melted within 2 hours. I&rsquo;ll probably end up going back to the growler.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>
					Ride Strategy
				</h2>
				<p>
					Every ride now it seems like I get at least 1 one-mile split time that is greater than 30 mph. Today I had one at 30.6 mph and I had 4 splits that were in the 29 to 29.9 mph range.
				</p>
				<p>
					It takes forever to accelerate to 30, but once there it is easy to hold on level ground. I need to really work on the accleration. It is probably related to shifting quickly and precisely into the 60 tooth front chainring. I can get to 25-26 mph quickly by just staying in the middle front chainring.
