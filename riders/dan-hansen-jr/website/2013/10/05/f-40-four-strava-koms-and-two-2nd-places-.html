				F-40 Video of Strava KOM 5.1 mile segment @ 28.1 mph
			</h1>
			<p>
				05 Oct 2013
			</p>
			<p>
				Started out the first nine miles pretty easy averaging 18.6 mph. Once I reached Ronald Reagan Blvd I knew I was feeling strong. I had the video camera mounted on my helmet and turned it on just before rounding the corner to head north on Ronald Reagan. I had seen an upright bike cross the intersection about 1/2 mile in front of me so I started pouring it on to see if I could catch them.
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;m starting to acclimate and really understand how to ride the F-40.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once I got the bike speed up to 27 mph I put the front chainring into the big 60 tooth gear and just kept mashing those big 175 mm cranks at 80 to 90 rpm for all I was worth. A little bit of coasting once the speed got about 35 mph to catch my breath - but it was pretty much an all out effort most of the way.
			</p>
			<p>
				11 minutes and one second for the KOM. A full 30 seconds faster than the last time I tried it and a full minute faster than the 2nd place professional triathlete! The best I ever did on this segment with the Musashi with fresh legs and wind at my back was 21.1 mph giving me 49th place on the KOM.

				Today was a very fast day!
			</p>
			<p>
				Two days of rest combined with a small amount of time to ride (work commitments) makes for a very fast ride.
			</p>
			<p>
				Four KOMS and two 2nd place finishes!
