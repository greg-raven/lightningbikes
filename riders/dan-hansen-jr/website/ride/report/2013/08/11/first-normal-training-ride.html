				First normal easy training ride
			</h1>
			<p>
				11 Aug 2013
			</p>
			<p>
				The legs are getting really tired and need a rest day. So, today I decided to just easy peddle it on my normal 41 mile training ride.
			</p>
			<p>
				41 miles @ 18.2 average speed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Had to stop for a few minutes after the first couple of miles to tighten down the left side rear view mirror. I&rsquo;m going to have to get a bunch of lock washers because the rough Texas chip seal can vibrate pretty bad sometimes.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was my first experience in busy traffic, stop lights, left hand turns, etc. My handling of the F-40 has become mostly second nature at lower speeds. I&rsquo;m still working on the high speed flying part.
			</p>
			<p>
				My heart rate on this bike is much greater than my heart rate on the Musashi or Baron. I wonder if it is because I&rsquo;m sitting up in a much higher position?
			</p>
			<p>
				Strava marked me as having 250KM for the month (158 miles) - 60 miles as a P-38 and 98 miles as an F-40.
