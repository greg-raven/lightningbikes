				F-40 Leg is good to go! 30 miles @ 18.5 mph!
			</h1>

				Just finished my first ride on the F-40 in over two weeks. Looks like the leg is healed and good to go!
			</p>
			<p>
				Overcast day with a slightly gusting wind. I have not ridden the F-40 for over two weeks so I spent a lot of time riding the brakes to keep the speed under 30 mph. Still, it was a fast ride for me.

				I&rsquo;ve spent the last couple of days working on the F-40 in preparation for the &rsquo;24 Hours in the Canyon&rsquo; race. Put a water bottle on to hold my homemade sports drink. Sports drink works like a champ! A couple of swigs every hour and you&rsquo;re good.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mounted two rear facing DiNotte red flashing lights. One on to begin with - when it runs out of battery turn the other one on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally fixed my tire flatting issues. I&rsquo;m going to keep the marathon supremes on just so that I don&rsquo;t have to fuss with flats for a while.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other day I busted my Camelbak unbottle so I dragged out a really older version of the unbottle. I like it better than the newer versions.
