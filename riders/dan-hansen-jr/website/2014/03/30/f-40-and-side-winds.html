					F-40 Side winds and top speed over 40 mph
				</h1>
				<p>
					30 Mar 2014
				</p>
				<p>
					Every since I&rsquo;ve had the F-40 strong gusty side winds have been challenging. Additionally, no matter how steep the hill I could not get the top speed over 40 mph.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some feedback from existing F-40 owners on the web suggested that dealing with gusty side winds could be done by poking your elbow out into the windward side. I adopted that behavior and talk about it here: <a href="../../../2013/09/17/f-40-sticking-your-elbow-into-the-wind.html">http://danhansenjr.com/2013/09/17/f-40-sticking-your-elbow-into-the-wind.html</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, it turns out the problem was actually different and I now don&rsquo;t have to perform the elbow out maneuver any more.
				</p>
				<p>
					When riding at the HOT Rally (Heart of Texas) in Austin this year I got to spend some time with Carl Murdock on the warrior ride who took the following picture of me riding the F-40.
				</p>
				<p>
					<img class="img-thumbnail" src="../../../img/2014-03-30-f40-old-arrow.png" alt="bordered" title="Picture" height="326" width="432">
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice where the red arrow points to the wind pushing the bottom spandex inwards. I was also having a problem with getting the top speed of the F-40 over 40 mph. Carl said that for a fast F-40 the spandex needs to be as smooth as possible down the sides to keep the airflow uninterrupted as much as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the picture above the spandex is bowed in by the wind and in effect is capturing the wind like a parachute and really slowing me down.
				</p>
				<p>
					Carl in the past had talked to Tyger Johnson who indicated that installing coroplast sheeting along the bottom area would smooth the airflow. I looked inside Carl&rsquo;s F-40 to see how he had done it and Friday I bought some coroplast and installed it on my F-40.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					In the below pictures you can see on the right how I have installed the coroplast on the bottom section of the F-40. (I positioned the F-40 just right in the sun light so that the sheet could be seen through the spandex).
				</p>
				<table class="table">
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Before</th>
							<th>After</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td><img class="img-thumbnail" src="../../../img/2014-03-30-f40-old-arrow.png" alt="bordered" title="Picture" height="326" width="432"></td>

						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<p>
					I pulled down the spandex in the next two pictures so that you can see how the coroplast was installed. Basically, I just cut a 12 inch by 48 inch piece of the coroplast along the grain so that bending it would bow it and not fold it. I fastened it with some zip ties.

					Yesterday I did the Salado Smoke &rsquo;N Spokes (Salado Texas) charity ride in winds 15 mph gusting to 21 mph. Read about it here <a href="/riders/dan-hansen-jr/website/2014/03/28/f-40-salado-smoken-spokes-100k.html">http://danhansenjr.com/2014/03/29/f-40-salado-smoken-spokes-100k.html</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The gusty winds were no factor. Several times I was riding 30+ mph when hit with a pretty good side gust and the effect was very minimal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, on this ride I was also able to break 40 mph for the first time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Looks like I need to spend more time cleaning up the airflow.
