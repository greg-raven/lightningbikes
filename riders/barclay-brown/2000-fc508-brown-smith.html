			<h1>
				FC508, What I&rsquo;ve learned
			</h1>
			<p>
				By Brenda Smith, Crew chief for <a href="/riders/barclay-brown/2000-fc508-barclay-brown-f40.html">Barclay Beetle Brown&rsquo;s FC508 Oct 2000</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Barclay had a spectacular race with a very respectable finish in this year&rsquo;s Furnace Creek 508, despite some unbelievable obstacles. Racing in his fully faired Lightning F-40 recumbent bike, the Beetle was vying for a top position with the race leaders through the first half of the race. We have reason to believe he would have finished at the top, too &hellip; had it not been for a fiery high-speed blow-out on the downside of Townes Pass into Stovepipe Wells, the steepest descent of the course.
			</p>
			<p>
				My crew partner, Barclay&rsquo;s girlfriend Jessica, is a gorgeous, bright, enthusiastic athlete (top level volleyball player) who is a really good sport about living in a smelly van for 2 days. Barclay insisted we had the qualifications to do this: Namely, we have driver&rsquo;s licenses and know how to make tuna sandwiches. Barclay will share his views on the race, but from the crew perspective, here are my lessons from FC508 2000:
			</p>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;ve learned:
			</p>
			<ul class="zot">
				<li>You can never have too much duct tape and electrical tape.</li>
				<li>No matter how careful you are with the ice, the van floor gets soaked.</li>
				<li>The approach of a Banana Slug will make the cyclist go faster than any Power Gel or Rock &amp; Roll tune ever could.</li>
				<li>If &ldquo;girlfriend intuition&rdquo; says that you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;leap frogged too far ahead of your rider,&rdquo; you probably have.</li>
				<li>&quot;Hey, Mr. DJ, put a record on &hellip;&rdquo; Oldies rock and roll is only entertaining for about 25 minutes on the external speakers, then it&rsquo;s time to put on some new stuff.</li>
				<li>When the brake friction on the wheel rim heats up to the point that it blows out the tire, you can actually see flames!!!</li>
				<li>When seeing her boyfriend crash his bike at high speed, a girlfriend will scream a string of expletives that would make a sailor blush.</li>
				<li>After a crash, never mention the word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; if the bike is still operational.</li>
				<li>Making the downed cyclist repair his own tire is a good distraction from the pain of the injuries. Or the crew could actually learn to fix a flat.</li>
				<li>Again, duct tape! It will repair anything from a torn fairing to a torn-open ankle.</li>
				<li>Greek Salad at the Mad Greek will do wonders for body, mind and spirit.</li>
				<li>You can drive the crew van while seeing double (side-by-side F-40s!), or with eyes closed, provided this is your SECOND FC508 (not for rookie crew members).</li>
				<li>Lavatory facilities? Or is that just another 508 mirage?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				end
