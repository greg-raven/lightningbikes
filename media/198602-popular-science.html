				Fastest bicycle in the world: <del>59.12</del> 61.44 mph <small>(February 1986)</small>
			</h1>
			<p class="lead">
				By Stuart F. Brown<br>
				<i>Popular Science</i>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Human-powered-vehicle designers are relentlessly pursuing new speed records for unmotorized transportation. The competition is fierce; the world&rsquo;s record for two-wheeled vehicles has recently changed hands twice. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This is work. With two human legs as the sole source of power, pushing a streamlined speed-record bicycle even 10 mph faster is like hammering on a brick wall with your bare fists &mdash; except the wall is the atmosphere. Like the bricks, it doesn&rsquo;t want to get out of the way.
			</p>
			<p>
				As I witnessed recently at the 11th annual speed championships held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway by the International Human-Powered Vehicle Assn. (IHPVA, Box 2068, Seal Beach, Calif. 90740), builders of human-powered vehicles (HPVs) are boundlessly inventive in their quest for ever-higher speeds. In the past several months their sleek creations have twice knocked over a world&rsquo;s speed record for two-wheeled vehicles, set at the 1984 Indy meet by Tim Brummer&rsquo;s 57.91-mph Lightning X2. I found the motorless aerodynamic speedsters [&ldquo;Man-Powered Racers,&rdquo; <i>PS,</i> Oct. &rsquo;80] endearingly quiet as they whooshed past during their flying-start 200-meter time trial runs.
			</p>
			<p>
				When Terry Hreno&rsquo;s Moby 3 made its 59.12-mph record run at Indianapolis, the builder was ecstatic. Exulting in the pits after the results were announced over the loud-speakers, Hreno crowed: &ldquo;We did it. I can&rsquo;t believe we finally beat Vector!&rdquo; He was referring to the three-wheeled vehicle built by Al Voigt that had set a long-standing single-rider vehicle record of 58.89 mph back in 1980.
			</p>
			<p>
				Actually, the first vehicle to beat the single-rider Vector&rsquo;s record was a tricycle built by Don Witte. It made a 61.94-mph run last August in Colorado; Hreno&rsquo;s vehicle officially took the title of fastest bicycle. (As <i>PS</i> went to press, I learned that a bicycle built by Gardner Martin of Freedom, Calif., and ridden by Fred Markham at a level location in the Sierra Nevada mountain range was officially clocked at 61.44 mph.)
			</p>
			<p>
				If there&rsquo;s a trend afoot, it seems to be toward two-wheeled machines. &ldquo;I think the two-wheelers have more of a future. It&rsquo;s easier to make a two-wheeler go faster because it has one less wheel hole in the fairing than a three-wheeler does,&rdquo; says Glen Brown, president of IHPVA.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Wheel holes are critical to aerodynamics,&rdquo; Brown explains. &ldquo;Less than half the drag is on the outside of the fairing; a tremendous amount of drag comes from air entering the wheel holes.&rdquo; Two-wheelers are also taller and narrow at the bottom, so they stay above the ground effect, which can trap air underneath and increase drag.
			</p>
			<p>
				Getting the fairing&rsquo;s shape right is all-important. Brown describes &ldquo;wind tunnel&rdquo; testing on a home-builder&rsquo;s budget: &ldquo;You attach wool tufts to the fairing, and then follow the HPV in a car to watch the way the air flows. The tufts should point straight back.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Now the question is, Who will build the first single-rider vehicle to go 65 mph and grab the $17,000 Du Pont Prize for Human-Powered Speed? Some predict the coveted award will soon be claimed as HPV designers on both shores of the Atlantic field increasingly fast machines.
