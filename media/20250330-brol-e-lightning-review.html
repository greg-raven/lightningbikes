					Color-Coordinating with the E-Lightning!

			<p>
				Years ago (decades, actually), I bought a used Lightning P-38. Alas, it was a bit too small for me, so I sold it &mdash; and looked forward to the next time, being sure to get the correct size! I have yet to do that, but I was lucky enough to get another Lightning to review: the e-Lightning! I&rsquo;ve been riding whenever the weather cooperated for the last several weeks &mdash; and my thoughts on this new bike? Read on!
			</p>
			<p>
				Those of you who are familiar with my reviews know that I don&rsquo;t just concentrate on the good points, that I actually try to find something about the product I don&rsquo;t like. Sometimes this is a minor quibble, and that may be the case now. Regardless, let&rsquo;s get that out of the way first, OK? Then we can smile and become even more eager to ride this new bike!
			</p>
			<p>
				OK, here it is: the weight of the bike. The specifications indicate that the e-Lightning weighs 48 pounds. And yes, that&rsquo;s due to the rear hub/motor, battery, and the rear rack that I told them I just couldn&rsquo;t live without! This won&rsquo;t come as a surprise to any of you who have been around the increasingly-popular e-assisted bikes and trikes. The facts are clear: motors and batteries add noticeable weight! About the only time this seems to be an issue, though, is when I want to put the bike in the back of my Subaru. Is it worth the effort? And really, this is not much different than non-motorized fat-tire bikes.
			</p>
			<p>
				You bet it is! This bike has five levels of assist (as well as a throttle), and battery life is dependent on these parameters: rider weight, terrain, and level of assist. I have ridden on both hilly and flat routes, and I do alternate the levels, and the listed mileage figures on the Lightning website seem to be pretty accurate. Given flat terrain, the numbers are 25 to 95 miles, varying at the speed you&rsquo;re going. The 25 miles are at a speed of 24 mph, while a speed of 16 gives you that longer distance. I tend to vary my settings &mdash; and I am not always trying to set a speed record, nor put a lot of distance between me and my riding friends. And, the lower the setting, the more effort you are physically putting into the ride, which brings me to one of the questions I&rsquo;ve been asked: this bike has a torque-sensing pedal-assist, so how does that compare with another popular pedal-assist, the cadence-sensing?
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you ride both, you&rsquo;ll feel the difference. The latter keeps your physical effort at about the same level, and it assists based on your cadence, your revolutions-per-minute. The torque-sensing, on the other hand, varies the assistance on how hard you&rsquo;re pedaling. If you are really mashing it, you&rsquo;ll get more assistance. Which is better? That&rsquo;s hard to say, and will be a personal preference. I have used both, and I like them both.
			</p>
			<p>
				OK, and now for some other aspects of the new e-Lightning, aside from the e-assist. It handles like what we would expect from this company: great! Yes, if you&rsquo;re a trike rider, slow and tight turns will make you nervous at first, but it handles them with no surprises. Comfort is good &mdash; I do love that seat &mdash; though if you are used to riding something with suspension, you&rsquo;ll notice that rumble strips are no fun, but in general, the bike is comfortable enough that I would not hesitate to take it out for a century ride.
			</p>
			<p>
				Two things that I must mention: the hydraulic disc brakes and the throttle. The brakes are smooth and can almost literally stop you on-a-dime. Be careful when you apply them, as you don&rsquo;t want to risk skidding or worse! As for the throttle &mdash; it really comes in handy in some situations, such as starting off on a slight up-hill. Getting those feet up on the pedals in time, going so slowly, can be hazardous. Using this throttle, without the need to pedal at all, gets you up and rolling, making it much easier to put those feet in place and get going!
			</p>
			<p>
				As you might have guessed by this point: I do like this bike! It&rsquo;s comfortable to ride, lets you choose your effort (no more accusations of <q>cheating</q>), has thumb-shifting of its nine speeds, and a display that shows you approximately how much battery you have left (at the current setting), as well as the expected odometer numbers. I have to admit, when I first ride anything that&rsquo;s e-assisted, I go for that highest setting, just to experience speeds that are not my usual. But, I have found that level 3 is more than OK with me. I get very nice performance, and no worries about the battery going empty before I get home!
