			<h1>
				The Argus Race &hellip; and the mean machine that won it
			</h1>
			<p>
				by Mark Stansfield<br>
				<i>Weekend Argus</i> Reporter<br>
				1988
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s a super dream-machine in disguise!
			</p>
			<p>
				The weird-looking recumbent bicycle which earned Lloyd Wright the laurels in this year&rsquo;s Argus/M Net Cycle Tour is in fact Lightning 2 in disguise.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lightning 2 is the bicycle that has broken the world speed record three times. It was &ldquo;imported&rdquo; by John Stegmann recently minus its own distinctive fairings, which were left in America.
			</p>
			<p>
				No wonder Mr. Wright flashed past the winning post and knocked more that seven minutes off last year&rsquo;s winning time.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Lightning 2 is purely a speed bike and has been clocked at 104km over a low-altitude 200m sprint,&rdquo; Mr. Wright said today.
			</p>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s so light it cannot be ridden in winds over 12 knots because it would just be blown about.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s weather conditions were absolutely perfect,&rdquo; he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;I have ridden John Stegmann&rsquo;s bikes in the last cople of Argus Cycle Tours.
			</p>
			<p>
				&ldquo;This year I had decided I wasn&rsquo;t going to ride a recumbent &mdash; and then he phoned and said he had managed to bring Lightning 2 over. The opportunity was too good to be missed.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				The super-cycle was bought for R6,000 by Mr. Stegmann. With its original fairing it would have cost R20,000, Mr. Wright said.
