				Penseyres and Solon set records

				Pete Penseyres won the $5,000 Paul Mitchell Prize by cycling from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 18 hours!

Looking like a fish from the side and a watermelon seed from the front, the X-2 weighs around 75 pounds with sereval gallons of water and UltraEnergy on board, and has lights, turn signals, fully enclosed fiberglass body &hellip; everything but fuzzy dice hanging from the rear view mirror.
			</p>
			<p>
				The route featured El Camino Real, Pacheco Pass, and I-5. Penseyres had projected a time of 17 hours, which he might have attained had he not lost time repairing the bike after attempting to turn too sharply and crashing.
