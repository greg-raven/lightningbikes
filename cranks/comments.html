			<h1>
				What customers say about Lightning Carbon Cranks &hellip;
			</h1>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					&ldquo;The Lightning shifting was actually better (with Stronglight Zephyr rings, 50/36 and Red FD) than it was on my Campag Ultra torque non-compact set-up: shifting between rings was a little quicker and I never dropped the chain off the inside, which happened very occasionally with the Campag.&rdquo; &mdash; Graham B.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;When I spend a good deal of money on something, my philosophy is that I had better see and feel a difference right away. That&rsquo;s exactly what happened with the cranks. Straight away I knew they were so much more efficient and faster. The first ride was a 30 mile out-and-back ride. I know all the time checks at the various points and know my best times there. At the 20 minute mark I was 1 minute faster. At the 30 minute mark I was 90 seconds faster. At the 15 mile turnaround point I was 3 minutes faster!
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;I averaged 19 mph at the end and I think my best average before was 18.3. All this without trying to hammer and go faster. I guess the efficiency and weight savings did it all. So far I have done 3 rides and am amazed each time I ride it. It feels like I have a continuous tail wind. One of the Cat 3 dudes tried to shake me off his wheel twice going to the finale and he couldn&rsquo;t drop me. I was holding on without too much effort. Just amazing! My hat&rsquo;s off to Lightning. Thanks.&rdquo;

					&ldquo;Thanks Tim for getting the <a href="/cranks/index.html">carbon cranks</a> to me in time to use them on this ride. They are sweet.&rdquo;
