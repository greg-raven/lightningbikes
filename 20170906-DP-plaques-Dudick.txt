Name recognition

Apparently there is a controversy about what to put on the plaque on the Yucca Loma Bridge. I suggest they dedicate it to the taxpaying citizens of the town. If the Lords and Lady of the Town Council crave such attention and recognition, maybe they should pass an ordinance to put their names on the walls of all public restrooms in the town instead.

After all, not everyone will use the bridge, but all of us at one time or another uses the latter.
